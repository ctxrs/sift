# Adapted public source

- bpe 0.2.2, `backtrack_encoder.rs`, `bitfield.rs`, `byte_pair_encoding.rs`, commit 6d4fd2ff14d384d34dc7a8280d5194788e0c7873 of https://github.com/github/rust-gems, MIT.
- bpe-openai 0.3.1, ordinary o200k regex/piece adapter, commit 01fa926a119793979a2ce38f8d5cae10950b7181 of the same repository, MIT.
- aneubeck-daachorse 1.1.1, leftmost-longest state traversal and output selection, package commit 8afdb8add8610fbcfc579521de25c5eb18bc91ee, MIT selection of MIT OR Apache-2.0.

The tokenizer preserves the above counting/traversal algorithms. The build validates the rkyv tables and dense DFA; runtime access borrows the exact immutable, aligned embedded bytes without repeating that validation. DFA generation requires matching build-host and target endianness. The pair map uses the archived hash table; regex-automata provides the precompiled dense DFA. Omitted fields belonged only to APIs not present on this valid count-only type.

# rkyv 0.8.18

Archive support uses rkyv commit 8db673416b5489f39793e654145ceb938d652c84, https://github.com/rkyv/rkyv. Checked access with bytecheck validates generated tables during the build; runtime unchecked access is limited to the immutable embedded archive.
